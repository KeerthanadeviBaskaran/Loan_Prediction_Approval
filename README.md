# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Banks face difficulty in deciding whether a loan should be approved.
This project predicts loan approval based on applicant details.

## 🧠 Solution
A Machine Learning classification model is built to predict:
- Loan Approved (Yes / No)

## 📊 Dataset
Loan Prediction Dataset from Kaggle.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning
3. Encoding Categorical Variables
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training (Logistic Regression)
6. Model Evaluation
7. Visualization
8. Model Saving

## 📈 Results
- Achieved ~75% accuracy
- Credit history is the most important factor

## 📌 Conclusion
The model effectively predicts loan approval and helps automate banking decisions.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add more features
- Try Random Forest
- Deploy using Flask
